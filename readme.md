# ZIPCOMIC (more like pdfcomic now)

A project that allows you to scrap manga websites to retrieve the images and transform it into a pdf file or a directory that you can turn into a zip. The project is not finished. To register a new scan website you must inspect it and find a few css selectors to put in the json-like object in the getSiteSpecs function.
